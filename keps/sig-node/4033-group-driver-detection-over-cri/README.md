**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

This enhancement adds the ability for the container runtime to instruct kubelet
which cgroup driver to use. This removes the need for specifying cgroup driver
in the kubelet configuration and eliminates the possibility of misaligned
cgroup driver configuration between the kubelet and the runtime.

## Motivation

The responsibility of managing the Linux cgroups is currently split between the
kubelet and the container runtime. Kubelet takes care of the pod (sandbox)
level cgroups whereas the runtime is responsible for per-container cgroups.
There currently are two different low-level management interfaces for cgroups:
manipulating the cgroupfs directly or using the systemd system management
daemon to manage them. Currently, both the kubelet and the container runtime
has a configuration setting for selecting the cgroup driver (cgroupfs or
systemd). These settings must be in sync, both kubelet and the runtime
configured to use the same driver as the two drivers are incompatible because
of a different kind of cgroups hierarchy used in them. Having kubelet and the
container runtime to use non-matching cgroup drivers can cause hard to
understand failures in container creation or inconsistent resource allocation
on the node. This – two independent configuration settings for the same thing –
is a common cause for user errors. Instead of having a split brain situation,
there should be a single source of truth for the cgroup driver.

### Goals

- make kubelet automatically use the same cgroup driver as the container
  runtime, making it unnecessary to specify cgroup driver in kubelet
  configuration
- maintain backward compatibility to run kubelet on top of an older container
  runtime that doesn’t support this new feature

### Non-Goals

## Proposal

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As a cluster administrator, I would like to simplify my node configuration by
configuring fields just once, and not needing to synchronize between multiple
processes.

#### Story 2

As a novice Kubernetes user, I would like to easily be able to start pods with
all runtimes, even if they have differing opinions on defaults.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

Field adoption could be considered a risk, though the CRI implementations work
closely with SIG Node and the feature will move along with CRI implementation
adoption.

## Design Details

### CRI API

Extend the CRI runtime API to inform the kubelet which cgroup driver should be
used. A new RuntimeConfig rpc is added to query the information.

```diff
 // Runtime service defines the public APIs for remote container runtimes
 service RuntimeService {
 ...
+    // RuntimeConfig returns configuration information of the runtime.
+    // A couple of notes:
+    // - The RuntimeConfigRequest object is not to be confused with the contents of UpdateRuntimeConfigRequest.
+    //   The former is for having runtime tell Kubelet what to do, the latter vice versa.
+    // - It is the expectation of the Kubelet that these fields are static for the lifecycle of the Kubelet.
+    //   The Kubelet will not re-request the RuntimeConfiguration after startup, and CRI implementations should
+    //   avoid updating them without a full node reboot.
+    rpc RuntimeConfig(RuntimeConfigRequest) returns (RuntimeConfigResponse) {}
 }
 
+message RuntimeConfigRequest {}
 
+message RuntimeConfigResponse {
+    // Configuration information for Linux-based runtimes. This field contains
+    // global runtime configuration options that are not specific to runtime
+    // handlers.
+    LinuxRuntimeConfiguration linux = 1;
+}
 
+message LinuxRuntimeConfiguration {
+    // Cgroup driver to use
+    // Note: this field should not change for the lifecycle of the Kubelet,
+    // or while there are running containers.
+    // The Kubelet will not re-request this after startup, and will construct the cgroup
+    // hierarchy assuming it is static.
+    // If the runtime wishes to change this value, it must be accompanied by removal of
+    // all pods, and a restart of the Kubelet. The easiest way to do this is with a full node reboot.
+    CgroupDriver cgroup_driver = 1;
+}
 
+enum CgroupDriver {
+    SYSTEMD = 0;
+    CGROUPFS = 1;
+}
```

### Kubelet

Kubelet will be modified to support the new field.

If available the cgroup driver information received from the container runtime
will take precedence over cgroupDriver setting from the kubelet config (or
`--cgroup-driver` command line flag). If the runtime does not provide
information about the cgroup driver, then kubelet will fall back to using its
own configuration (`cgroupDriver` from kubeletConfig or the `--cgroup-driver`
flag). Further, the kubeletConfig field and `--cgroup-driver` flag will be
marked as deprecated, to be dropped when support for the feature is adopted by
CRI-O and containerd. Usage of the deprecated setting will produce a log
message, e.g.:

```
cgroupDriver option has been deprecated and will be dropped in a future release. Please upgrade to a CRI implementation that supports cgroup-driver detection.
```

Kubelet startup is modified so that connection to the CRI server (container
runtime) is established and RuntimeConfig is queried before initializing the
kubelet internal container-manager which is responsible for kubelet-side cgroup
management. If supported by the runtime, RuntimeConfig query is expected to
succeed, an error (error response or timeout) is regarded as a failed
initialization of the runtime service and kubelet will exit with an error
message and an error code.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

No prerequisites have been identified.

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime`: `2023-06-15` - `66.1%`

Kubelet unit tests that use the
[fake_runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api/blob/master/pkg/apis/testing/fake_runtime_service.go)
will be updated to verify the Kubelet is correctly inheriting the cgroup
driver:

- If CRI returns "Not Implemented", Kubelet falls back to its own internal cgroup driver
- If CRI returns an error, Kubelet fails to run
- If CRI returns the cgroup driver, Kubelet overrides its cgroup driver to use the one returned by CRI.

##### Integration tests

<!--
Integration tests are contained in k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration.
Integration tests allow control of the configuration parameters used to start the binaries under test.
This is different from e2e tests which do not allow configuration of parameters.
Doing this allows testing non-default options and multiple different and potentially conflicting command line options.
-->

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

No new integration tests for kubelet are planned.

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

No new e2e tests for kubelet are planned.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, [feature gate] graduations, or as
something else. The KEP should keep this high-level with a focus on what
signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

#### Alpha

- [ ] Feature implemented behind a feature flag, fallback to old behavior if flag is enabled but runtime support not present.
- [ ] Initial unit tests completed and enabled


#### Beta

- [ ] Feature implemented, with the feature gate enabled by default.
- [ ] Released versions of CRI-O and containerd runtime implementations support the feature
- [ ] Record an Event into the API that runtime should be upgraded.

#### GA

- [ ] No bugs reported in the previous cycle.
- [ ] Remove fallback behavior. CRI implementations expected to have support.
- [ ] Remove feature gate

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

The fallback behavior specified in alpha will prevent the majority of regressions, as Kubelet will choose a cgroup driver,
same as it used to before this KEP, even when the feature gate is on.

The feature gate is another layer of protection, requiring admins to specifically opt-into this behavior.

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

If either kubelet or the container runtime running on the node does not support
the new field in the CRI API, they just resort to the existing behavior of
respecting their individual cgroup-driver setting. That is, if the node has a
container runtime that does not support this field the kubelet will use its
cgroupDriver setting from kubeletConfig (or `--cgroup-driver` commandline
flag). This is also the case if the kubelet does not support the new field:
the information about cgroup driver advertised by the runtime will be just
ignored by kubelet and it will resort to its own configuration settings. Note:
this does present a configuration skew risk, but that risk is the same as
currently exists today.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [X] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kubelet

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

Yes. If/when the runtime is updated to a version that supports this, kubelet
will ignore the cgroupDriver config option/flag. However, this change in
behavior should not cause any breakages (on the contrary, it should fix
scenarios where the kubelet `--cgroup-driver` setting is incorrectly
configured). With old versions of the container runtimes (that don't support
the new field in the CRI API) the default behavior is not changed.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

Feature gates are typically disabled by setting the flag to `false` and
restarting the component. No other changes should be necessary to disable the
feature.

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

Yes, through the feature gate.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Kubelet starts to use the cgroup driver instructed by the runtime. Potentially
fixing a broken/misbehaving node if the kubelet cgroupDriver option (or
`--cgroup-driver` flag) was incorrectly set.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282
-->

Unit tests for the feature gate will be written.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

A rollout/rollback could fail only in the way it currently does: cgroup driver
skew between CRI server (containe runtime) and Kubelet resulting in nodes going
NotReady. This is only possible when the CRI server and Kubelet are not both
upgraded to support the feature and are both not configured to agree on the
CgroupDriver as they must be today.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

Nodes being in NotReady state with kubelet logs indicating an error in the
RuntimeConfig CRI request, making kubelet fail to start.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

Not planned as there is no persistent state associated with the feature. Manual
testing of the feature gate (in addition to the unit tests) is performed.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

Yes, the CgroupDriver field of the Kubelet configuration (and the corresponding
`--cgroup-driver` flag) will be marked as deprecated, but won’t be dropped
until wide adoption of the field on CRI has been done.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

Kubelet and container runtime version. The
[`crictl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/crictl/) tool
can be used to determine if the container runtime supports the feature (`crictl
info`).

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

No metrics likely will expose this. Examining kubelet logs whould inform the
that the cgroup driver setting instructed by the runtime is being used.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

N/A.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

N/A.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

N/A.

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

A CRI (server) implementation of the correct version. However, the feature will
fallback if the CRI implementation doesn’t support the feature.

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

For the Kubernetes API, no.

For the CRI API, yes. Although the CRI fields and messages are not exposed to
the user.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

For the Kubernetes API, no.

For the CRI API, yes, minimally.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

Not noticeably.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

No.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

No.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

Not applicable. This feature is node-local and between kubelet and the
container runtime, only.

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

Same that exists today: Kubelet and the CRI server (container runtime) not
agreeing on the CgroupDriver while one of them doesn’t support the feature.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

N/A.

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

Make kubelet the configuration point for cgroup driver so that kubelet would
inform the runtime which cgroup driver to use. This could be achieved e.g.
without any changes to the CRI API by the CRI implementation guessing the
cgroup driver based on the path of the CgroupParent of the pod, passed down in
the RunPodSandboxRequest. However, SIG Node has decided that the CRI
implementation should begin to be the source of truth for low-level choices
like this, and thus this approach was chosen.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
